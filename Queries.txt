1. User opens GUI to view spots in the parking lot. We return to them a table that lists all vacant spots in the parking lot.

SELECT SpotNumber, Level
FROM ParkingSpot
	JOIN ParkingLot ON (ParkingLot.ID = ParkingSPot.ParkingLotID)
WHERE ParkingLot.Name = lotName AND LicensePlate IS null;

2. User wants to filter available spots based on the parking spot type.
   Through our filter, returns them a table that lists all the vacant spots of that type.

SELECT SpotNumber, Level, ParkingSpotType.Type
FROM ParkingSpot
	JOIN ParkingSpotType ON (ParkingSpotType.ID = ParkingSpot.ParkingSpotTypeID)
WHERE ParkingSpotType.Type = typeName AND LicensePlate IS null;

3. User enters in license plate, color, manufacturer, model, and type into GUI.
   We record and update the database accordingly. Returns if the data inputted is successful. 

INSERT INTO Vehicle
VALUES (plateNumber, color, manu, model, typeNum);

4. User parks their car in a vacant spot.
   Sensors record and update the database (simulated by manually entering data for the purpose of this project).

UPDATE ParkingSpot
SET ParkingSpot.LicensePlate = plateNumber
WHERE ParkingSpot.SpotNumber = spotNumber AND ParkingLot.Name = lotName;

INSERT INTO Payment
VALUES ('', plateNumber, 0, dateTime('now'), False);

5. User leaves their parking spot.
   Sensors record and update the database (simulated by manually entering data for the purpose of this project)

UPADTE ParkingSpot
SET PakingSpot.LicensePlate = null
WHERE ParkingSpot.SpotNumber = spotNumber AND ParkingLot.Name = lotName;

-- Need to add an update here that will set the duration in payment

6. User wants to view history of paid and unpaid payments by entering their license plate into the GUI.
   We return to them a table that lists all of the different payments registered to their license plate.
